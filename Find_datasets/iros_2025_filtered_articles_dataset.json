    "title": "User Experience Estimation in Human-Robot Interaction Via Multi-Instance Learning of Multimodal Social Signals",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.",

    "title": "Policy Learning from Large Vision-Language Model Feedback without Reward Modeling",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical. However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data, which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training. Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further validating its practical applicability.",

    "title": "Channel-wise Motion Features for Efficient Motion Segmentation",
    "abstract": "For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose, Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of the model increases, hindering real-time performance.   In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required. Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\\%$.",

    "title": "rt-RISeg: Real-Time Model-Free Robot Interactive Segmentation for Active Instance-Level Object Understanding",
    "abstract": "Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning, but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look, Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure detection - without additional information such as object detection or predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly. LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40% improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments, including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's effectiveness in replanning.

To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin while achieving real-time performance.

At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

This work seeks to elucidate basic principles of this sim-and-real cotraining to help inform simulation design, sim-and-real dataset creation, and policy training. Focusing narrowly on the canonical task of planar pushing from camera inputs enabled us to be thorough in our study. These experiments confirm that cotraining with simulated data \\emph{can} dramatically improve performance in real, especially when real data is limited. Performance gains scale with simulated data, but eventually plateau; real-world data increases this performance ceiling.

However, for non-feature based SLAM approaches, directly optimizing all the robot poses and the whole map will greatly increase the computational cost, making SLAM problems difficult to solve in large-scale environments. To solve the 2D non-feature based SLAM problem in large-scale environments more accurately and efficiently, we propose the grid-based submap joining method. Specifically, we first formulate the 2D grid-based submap joining problem as a non-linear least squares (NLLS) form to optimize the global occupancy map and local submap frames simultaneously. We then prove that in solving the NLLS problem using Gauss-Newton (GN) method, the increments of the poses in each iteration are independent of the occupancy values of the global occupancy map. Based on this property, we propose a poseonly GN algorithm equivalent to full GN method to solve the NLLS problem. The proposed submap joining algorithm is very efficient due to the independent property and the pose-only solution. Evaluations using simulations and publicly available practical 2D laser datasets confirm the outperformance of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy, as well as the ability to solve the grid-based SLAM problem in very large-scale environments.",

Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/longxianlei/SLTNet-v1.0.",

    "title": "Beacon: A Naturalistic Driving Dataset During Blackouts for Benchmarking Traffic Reconstruction and Control",
    "abstract": "Extreme weather and infrastructure vulnerabilities pose significant challenges to urban mobility, particularly at intersections where signals become inoperative. To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, Beacon is the first publicly available traffic dataset for naturalistic driving behaviors during blackouts at intersections.",

    "title": "Task-Aware Robotic Grasping by evaluating Quality Diversity Solutions through Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Task-aware robotic grasping is a challenging problem that requires the integration of semantic understanding and geometric reasoning. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms to enable zero-shot task-conditioned grasp synthesis. The framework segments objects into meaningful subparts and labels each subpart semantically, creating structured representations that can be used to prompt an LLM. By coupling semantic and geometric representations of an object's structure, the LLM's knowledge about tasks and which parts to grasp can be applied in the physical world. The QD-generated grasp archive provides a diverse set of grasps, allowing us to select the most suitable grasp based on the task. We evaluated the proposed method on a subset of the YCB dataset with a Franka Emika robot. A consolidated ground truth for task-specific grasp regions is established through a survey. Our work achieves a weighted intersection over union (IoU) of 73.6% in predicting task-conditioned grasp regions in 65 task-object combinations. An end-to-end validation study on a smaller subset further confirms the effectiveness of our approach, with 88% of responses favoring the task-aware grasp over the control group. A binomial test shows that participants significantly prefer the task-aware grasp.",

    "title": "AV-PedAware: Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Fusion for Dynamic Pedestrian Awareness",
    "abstract": "In this study, we introduce AV-PedAware, a self-supervised audio-visual fusion system designed to improve dynamic pedestrian awareness for robotics applications. Pedestrian awareness is a critical requirement in many robotics applications. However, traditional approaches that rely on cameras and LIDARs to cover multiple views can be expensive and susceptible to issues such as changes in illumination, occlusion, and weather conditions. Our proposed solution replicates human perception for 3D pedestrian detection using low-cost audio and visual fusion. This study represents the first attempt to employ audio-visual fusion to monitor footstep sounds for the purpose of predicting the movements of pedestrians in the vicinity. The system is trained through self-supervised learning based on LIDAR-generated labels, making it a cost-effective alternative to LIDAR-based pedestrian awareness. AV-PedAware achieves comparable results to LIDAR-based systems at a fraction of the cost. By utilizing an attention mechanism, it can handle dynamic lighting and occlusions, overcoming the limitations of traditional LIDAR and camera-based systems. To evaluate our approach's effectiveness, we collected a new multimodal pedestrian detection dataset and conducted experiments that demonstrate the system's ability to provide reliable 3D detection results using only audio and visual data, even in extreme visual conditions. We will make our collected dataset and source code available online for the community to encourage further development in the field of robotics perception systems.",

    "title": "Predictive Coding for Decision Transformer",
    "abstract": "Recent work in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated the effectiveness of formulating decision-making as return-conditioned supervised learning. Notably, the decision transformer (DT) architecture has shown promise across various domains. However, despite its initial success, DTs have underperformed on several challenging datasets in goal-conditioned RL. This limitation stems from the inefficiency of return conditioning for guiding policy learning, particularly in unstructured and suboptimal datasets, resulting in DTs failing to effectively learn temporal compositionality. Moreover, this problem might be further exacerbated in long-horizon sparse-reward tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the Predictive Coding for Decision Transformer (PCDT) framework, which leverages generalized future conditioning to enhance DT methods. PCDT utilizes an architecture that extends the DT framework, conditioned on predictive codings, enabling decision-making based on both past and future factors, thereby improving generalization. Through extensive experiments on eight datasets from the AntMaze and FrankaKitchen environments, our proposed method achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing popular value-based and transformer-based methods in offline goal-conditioned RL. Furthermore, we also evaluate our method on a goal-reaching task with a physical robot.",

    "title": "Dynamic Layer Detection of a Thin Materials using DenseTact Optical Tactile Sensors",
    "abstract": "Manipulation of thin materials is critical for many everyday tasks and remains a significant challenge for robots. While existing research has made strides in tasks like material smoothing and folding, many studies struggle with common failure modes (crumpled corners/edges, incorrect grasp con-figurations) that a preliminary step of layer detection can solve. We present a novel method for classifying the number of grasped material layers using a custom gripper equipped with DenseTact 2.0 optical tactile sensors. After grasping a thin material, the gripper performs an anthropomorphic rubbing motion while collecting optical flow, 6-axis wrench, and joint state data. Using this data in a transformer-based network achieves a test accuracy of 98.21% in correctly classifying the number of grasped cloth layers, and 81.25% accuracy in classifying layers of grasped paper, showing the effectiveness of our dynamic rubbing method. Evaluating different inputs and model architectures highlights the usefulness of tactile sensor information and a transformer model for this task. A comprehensive dataset of 568 labeled trials (368 for cloth and 200 for paper) was collected and made open-source along with this paper.

    "title": "Mamba Policy: Towards Efficient 3D Diffusion Policy with Hybrid Selective State Models",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been widely employed in the field of 3D manipulation due to their efficient capability to learn distributions, allowing for precise prediction of action trajectories. However, diffusion models typically rely on large parameter UNet backbones as policy networks, which can be challenging to deploy on resource-constrained devices. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising solution for efficient modeling, offering low computational complexity and strong performance in sequence modeling. In this work, we propose the Mamba Policy, a lighter but stronger policy that reduces the parameter count by over 80% compared to the original policy network while achieving superior performance. Specifically, we introduce the XMamba Block, which effectively integrates input information with conditional features and leverages a combination of Mamba and Attention mechanisms for deep feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Mamba Policy excels on the Adroit, Dexart, and MetaWorld datasets, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Additionally, we highlight the Mamba Policy's enhanced robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to baseline methods and explore the performance of various Mamba variants within the Mamba Policy framework. Real-world experiments are also conducted to further validate its effectiveness. Our open-source project page can be found at https://andycao1125.github.io/mamba_policy/.",

    "title": "Temporal and Semantic Evaluation Metrics for Foundation Models in Post-Hoc Analysis of Robotic Sub-tasks",
    "abstract": "Recent works in Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) show that training control policies on language-supervised robot trajectories with quality labeled data markedly improves agent task success rates. However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our results enable building diverse, large-scale, language-supervised datasets for improved robotic TAMP.",

    "title": "Multi-Agent Behavior Retrieval: Retrieval-Augmented Policy Training for Cooperative Push Manipulation by Mobile Robots",
    "abstract": "Due to the complex interactions between agents, learning multi-agent control policy often requires a prohibited amount of data. This paper aims to enable multi-agent systems to effectively utilize past memories to adapt to novel collaborative tasks in a data-efficient fashion. We propose the Multi-Agent Coordination Skill Database, a repository for storing a collection of coordinated behaviors associated with key vectors distinctive to them. Our Transformer-based skill encoder effectively captures spatio-temporal interactions that contribute to coordination and provides a unique skill representation for each coordinated behavior. By leveraging only a small number of demonstrations of the target task, the database enables us to train the policy using a dataset augmented with the retrieved demonstrations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly higher success rate in push manipulation tasks compared with baseline methods like few-shot imitation learning. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our retrieve-and-learn framework in a real environment using a team of wheeled robots.",

    "title": "Nothing Stands Still: A Spatiotemporal Benchmark on 3D Point Cloud Registration Under Large Geometric and Temporal Change",
    "abstract": "Building 3D geometric maps of man-made spaces is a well-established and active field that is fundamental to computer vision and robotics. However, considering the evolving nature of built environments, it is essential to question the capabilities of current mapping efforts in handling temporal changes. In addition, spatiotemporal mapping holds significant potential for achieving sustainability and circularity goals. Existing mapping approaches focus on small changes, such as object relocation or self-driving car operation; in all cases where the main structure of the scene remains fixed. Consequently, these approaches fail to address more radical changes in the structure of the built environment, such as geometry and topology. To this end, we introduce the Nothing Stands Still (NSS) benchmark, which focuses on the spatiotemporal registration of 3D scenes undergoing large spatial and temporal change, ultimately creating one coherent spatiotemporal map. Specifically, the benchmark involves registering two or more partial 3D point clouds (fragments) from the same scene but captured from different spatiotemporal views. In addition to the standard pairwise registration, we assess the multi-way registration of multiple fragments that belong to any temporal stage. As part of NSS, we introduce a dataset of 3D point clouds recurrently captured in large-scale building indoor environments that are under construction or renovation. The NSS benchmark presents three scenarios of increasing difficulty, to quantify the generalization ability of point cloud registration methods over space (within one building and across buildings) and time. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art methods on NSS. The results demonstrate the necessity for novel methods specifically designed to handle large spatiotemporal changes.

    "abstract": "While autonomous navigation of mobile robots on rigid terrain is a well-explored problem, navigating on deformable terrain such as tall grass or bushes remains a challenge. To address it, we introduce an explainable, physics-aware and end-to-end differentiable model which predicts the outcome of robot-terrain interaction from camera images, both on rigid and non-rigid terrain. The proposed MonoForce model consists of a black-box module which predicts robot-terrain interaction forces from onboard cameras, followed by a white-box module, which transforms these forces and a control signals into predicted trajectories, using only the laws of classical mechanics. The differentiable white-box module allows backpropagating the predicted trajectory errors into the black-box module, serving as a self-supervised loss that measures consistency between the predicted forces and ground-truth trajectories of the robot. Experimental evaluation on a public dataset and our data has shown that while the prediction capabilities are comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on rigid terrain, MonoForce shows superior accuracy on non-rigid terrain such as tall grass or bushes. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we release both the code and datasets.",

    "title": "Diffusion Policies for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods leverage previous experiences to learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.",
